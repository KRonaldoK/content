# Blockstreet Launches
Welcome to Blockstreet.io, where you can find the latest news, prices and information about cryptocurrencies. Our goal is to explain cryptocurrency to non-technical people, and explain the concepts in a clear, easy to understand way.

Our education section at the moment covers some basics of cryptocurrency with analogies that help readers build a mental model of how blockchain technology works.

I'm Josh, and I'll be focusing on the education section. I'm a computer scientist with a focus on web technologies, with an interest in security and cryptocurrencies.  I was first introduced to Bitcoin around 2013, but didn't really learn much about blockchain technology until nick introduced me to Ethereum in early 2017.  My goal is to help people understand this technology, because I believe it will end up being a part of our everyday lives in the near future.
