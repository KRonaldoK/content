# Blockstreet Launches
Welcome to Blockstreet! Our goal as a website is to explain the many concepts of cryptocurrency so that anyone can understand them. Alongside this, we aim to keep you up-to-date with new happenings in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. We would like to report on new initial coin offerings and give our analysis of them.

Our education section at the moment covers some basics of cryptocurrency with analogies that help readers build a mental model of how blockchain technology works. We hope to grow it into a complete guide that covers the inner workings of systems that cryptocurrencies use such as proof of stake, sharding, and mining.

I'm Josh, and I'll be focusing on the education section. I'm a computer scientist with a focus on web technologies, with an interest in security and cryptocurrencies.  I was first introduced to Bitcoin around 2013, but didn't really learn much about blockchain technology until nick introduced me to Ethereum in early 2017.  My goal is to help people understand this technology, because I believe it will end up being a part of our everyday lives in the near future.
