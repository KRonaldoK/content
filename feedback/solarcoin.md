"I would suggest putting in links for the ICO section so that people can easily go to the.
Also some of the ICO's like Golem and Gnosis have already started or may even be finished so this needs updated.
for Price Tracker consider allowing the user to select a smaller subset of the coins in the display and have it
auto-refresh so that someone could just keep it posted on their screen and watch the values change dynamically."

"Hi matt: this statement is wrong " Gold has intrinsic value. It can be made into jewelry, it’s conductive, so it
can be used in electrical stuff (such as your computer or smartphone) yet doesn’t rust, unlike copper. While it is
possible to make gold, the amount of money that it costs is more than the money you could get from selling it, which
means there is a limited amount of it. These reasons show why gold has value."   the intrinsic value of gold is actually
quite limited.  Gold actually functions as money which is why it has value.  Happy to explain."

"Do they have intrinsic value? Well, yes and no. For example, Bitcoin can be seen as a “store of value”
with its price being depending on supply and demand. The more people that think bitcoins are worth something,
the more people buy into it and the price goes up. Other forms of cryptocurrencies may have value because their
blockchains provide the capability to run “smart contracts” which are a list of actions that run according to a plan.
Smart contracts are a new concept but they are believed to provide safe ways of ensuring that two or more parties hold
up their end of a bargain. For instance, a smart contract could be made to automatically pay the pizza company when
the delivery man drops off the pizza. If the pizza never arrives, then the company never gets paid. But if the pizza
does arrive, then the customer cannot take the pizza and refuse to pay."

"you may also want to de-emphasize cryptocurrency as the lingo is kind of dying. "tokens" are more standard as most ICO's
are functional tokens which derive value from a utilization for "storage, computation, data etc."
