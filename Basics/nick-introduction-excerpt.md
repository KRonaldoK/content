## Where did it come from?
In 2008, a mysterious figure by the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" released a document describing a global digital currency that was controlled by no one individual, and instead shared amongst the population of the world on a system called the "Blockchain". This document spawned the first cryptocurrency "Bitcoin" that would eventually grow into hundreds of other crytpocurrencies.

## What is a Blockchain?
You may have heard the term "blockchain" before and wondered what it is. A blockchain is the underlying technology that allows cryptocurrencies to work. It is a record of all the transactions that have ever been made between people on the network. By looking at this list, you can determine how much money any individual person has. The major difference between a blockchain, and your bank's database of who has what, is that the blockchain is decentralized.

### Traditional Centralization
Due to your bank being centralized, they have complete control over transaction histories, and the balances in each account. They are free to modify the history and balances at their whim. The funds that you hold in a bank account are promises that you have that amount of money, when in reality it is lended elsewhere accumulating interest to the benefit of the bank. In situations where too many other people request their own money back, the banks are forced to limit or deny your request as seen throughout history.

### Decentralized
For something to be decentralized, it cannot be under the control of a specific person, and instead be under the control of every person at the same time. By doing this, a certain level of security is achieved because the history of transactions cannot be altered in any way. If everyone has an understanding of all transactions that have ever happened, and you tried to say otherwise, your opinion would be disregarded as false.
