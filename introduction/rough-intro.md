## Cryptocurrencies
In 2008, a mysterious figure by the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" released a document describing a global digital currency as a store of value that was controlled by no one individual, and instead shared amongst the population of the world on a system called the "Blockchain". This document spawned the first cryptocurrency "Bitcoin" that would eventually grow into hundreds of other cryptocurrencies.

You may be familiar with Bitcoin already; you may have heard it was used on the "darkweb" or heard about it skyrocketing to over 50 times it's value in less than a year. A cyptocurrency's value is based on supply and demand: if more people want it and are willing to pay for it, it's price goes up. If people don't want it, its price moves down. Similar to how if you wanted to make a purchase of a $1,000 laptop at a store with your debit card, the point-of-sale machine reads your card, determines your account information, then checks to see if you have enough money to make the purchase.

Cryptocurrencies accomplish this by using a system called a "blockchain". Suppose there are two people, Alice and Bob, who want to make a transaction, using a cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin). In simple terms, Alice wants to send 3 bitcoins to Bob. Alice's transaction is digitally signed to prove it came from her wallet. To check if Alice has enough money for the transaction, we look at a list of every transaction to every wallet since the start of Bitcoin.

## Blockchains
You may have heard the term "blockchain" before and wondered what it is. A blockchain is the underlying technology that allows cryptocurrencies to work. It is a record of all the transactions that have ever been made between people on the network. By looking at this ledger, you can determine how much money any individual person has.

#### Example
Let's imagine there is a community of people who use cryptocurrency to pay for products and services they desire. In this community there is an individual named Bobby. Whenever anyone in this group wants to send money to anyone else, they must first tell Bobby about the details of the transaction. In one instance, Carl wishes to gift $10 to Dave. Carl informs Bobby who checks Carl's ID and signature to make sure it's really him. Then Bobby reads through all of the transactions in his notebook to figure out how much money has come in and out of Carl's account to determine if he can afford the transaction. Upon confirmation, Bobby removes the money from Carl's account and adds it to Dave's and the transaction is complete.

This system may seem simple but it has one glaring flaw; Bobby must be a trustworthy member of the community. If he makes a mistake calculating balances or acts maliciously, the system becomes flawed and unfair. This is what is called a "single source of truth" system, which is used in modern day banking. Through the application of "decentralization" we can achieve a system where the power is removed from Bobby and instead distributed amongst all members of the community.

## Decentralization
A decentralized system is one where no individual in the network controls any significant portion of the something, whether that be power or the truth of truth. Voting is one such system, where everyone in the community comes together to make a decision without any one person having more opportunity to influence the outcome than any other person.

#### Example
Let's take the system we outlined in the previous example and apply a decentralized approach. In our new system, instead of all members of the community having to report their transactions to only Bobby, they instead tell every other member of the community about the transaction. The notebook that Bobby previous had control of has instead been duplicated so that every member has the same copy, and all transactions are kept up to date on everyone's notebooks at the same time.

This approach prevents the previous issue of Bobby making an error calculating balances or more importantly him acting maliciously. Now, if Bobby tries to change his notebook to claim he has more money than he really does, his notebook would have a different history than every other member of the community and his version would be ignored. When everyone has the source of truth, it cannot be manipulated.

Another important benefit of this approach, is if a member of the community loses their notebook, they can simply retrieve a copy of anyone else's notebook and rejoin the network. This prevents anyone from taking down the financial network the community has established as the attacker would have to burn the notebooks of everyone in the community which becomes unfeasible once the community reaches a certain size.

## Efficiency
While the decentralized approach from the above example may seem like a large improvement from the initial centralized approach we started with, there is still one key missing component that makes the system feasible for use. The fact that a member of the community has to inform every other member whenever they want to make a transaction makes for a rather tiring way of going about things.

Thanks to modern day technology, all of this informing, book-keeping and verification can be done on a computer. Given the fact that computers are millions of magnitudes faster than humans at processing data, these operations are performed near-instantly. This also allows for the system to scale to the population of the world, instead of the small community.


## What makes a cryptocurrency worth anything at all?
  You may be wondering how bits on the computer can possibly be worth anything at all.  Lets break it down using familiar examples.
  The US Dollar: a currency used to buy things in the United States.  A dollar is simply a piece of paper with some numbers on it.  What makes it worth anything more than a cryptocurrency?  You may be thinking, "isn't the dollar backed by gold?", but you'd be wrong.  It hasn't been backed by gold since [1934](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12770.htm).  But for the sake of simplicity, lets pretend we took a small trip back in time.  Gold has **intrinsic value**.  It can be made into jewelry, it's conductive, so it can be used in electrical applications(such as your computer or smartphone) yet resists oxidation, unlike copper.  There is also a limited amount of gold; while you technically can make gold, the process is too expensive to make it worthwhile to sell it afterwards.  These factors contribute to why gold has value.
  But what about cryptocurrencies?  
* Are they a limited resource?

  For most cryptocurrencies, there is a limited number of "coins" in circulation at any given time.  You can't simply "create" a bitcoin and add it to your wallet, due to complex cryptography and transaction logging.  These coins are currently created by "miners" who form the backbone of any cyptocurrency using Proof of Work.  Proof of Stake is a new concept that is going to be implemented into Ethereum so mining won't be necessary anymore.
  
* Do they have intrinsic value?

  Well, yes and no.  For example, Bitcoin can be seen as a "store of value", with its price being dictated by supply and demand.  The more people that think bitcoins are worth something, the more people buy into it, and consequently the price goes up.  Ethereum has intrinsic value because the blockchain provides the backbone for running "smart contracts", which can basically be a program of any kind.  You can interact with these contracts by sending Eth.  People who believe Ethereum is going to become more popular buy into it, and its price increases.
  
* Who's buying cryptocurrencies?

  People buy into cryptocurrencies for a few different reasons.
  	* They want to make money off them by purchasing them when their price is low, and selling them when the price is high.
	This is similar to playing the stock market.  Cryptocurrencies are much more volatile, and can possibly gain or lose upwards of 20% in a single day.  This makes them an ideal target for people interested in day trading them to try to out perform the market.
	* They believe in the underlying technology.
	Some people believe that cryptocurrencies are a natural progression for society.  They believe that eventually, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum will be commonplace, and used for everything from paying your electricity bill to purchasing food at a restaurant.
	
## What are some examples of cryptocurrencies?
### Bitcoin
Bitcoin is blockchain's first digital asset referred to as cryptocurrency. Its an innovative payment solution powered by blockchain technology. It acts as a peer to peer cash payment system and a storage of value with security built at its core. It was the first payment solution to solve the double-spend problem after the crash of 2008. Double-spending is the result of successfully spending some money more than once. Bitcoin, as seen on exchanges as (BTC) has a stock supply, generally called coins or tokens, of 21,000,000BTC which are divisible by 100M units per coin. Each unit is uniquely identifiable and programmable allowing users to assign custom properties to each unit. A unit can represent a USD, a share in a company, a KwH of energy, a digital certificate of ownership, 1,000 barrels of oil, loyalty credits or electoral votes. As of March 2017 each coin is worth $1,059 giving it a $17.2B market capitalization. Bitcoin leverages the blockchains open sourced codebase, referred to as an open API (application program interface) and created its own API allowing innovators to leverage its payment network for transacting and engineering new use cases.

### Ethereum
Ethereum is a decentralized digital contracts system. It is the first planetary scale computer allowing applications to run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference. It has the potential to be the secure backbone for everything from e-commerce to IoT enabling transparent governing systems for communities and businesses. It handles user authentication and securements, messaging and decentralized storage of data. Digital contracts are programmed rules that are enforced by Ethereums underlying core code which sits on top of the Blockchain and leverages portions of Bitcoins code. The programming is done on a feature executed on a browser called Mist which allows developers who are knowledgable in Java, C, Python to program "smart contracts". It has the 2nd largest market cap valued at $3.74B. It has the potential to be the next evolution of the worldwide web.

### Dash
Dash is easy to use digital cash for instant, private and secure transactions. Dash does this by leveraging several existing blockchain solutions such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Lightning Network which provides a faster way to transact. Dash automatically provides different sending and receiving address for every transaction all the while allowing each user to retain a private encrypted account authentication code that only they know. Dash’s premier technology Evolution make’s digital cash easy to use and access for all users, even those who aren’t technologically savvy. Anybody will be able to setup an account on the blockchain, add contacts and pay them by name. Purchases from websites or mobile apps will be simple, requiring only a single click. It is comparable to that of PayPal for blockchain. It enables the access of digital cash on any computer eliminating the need to store and access digital currency on one and only one device.
