**Blockchain** - a distributed open ledger that keeps a record of all transactions. A.K.A digital bookkeeping, that once was manual and now thanks to smart contracts are automated.

**Initial Coin Offering (ICO)** - a global crowd sale for new blockchain solutions. The core developer or team releases a white paper outlining the business plan, development road map and funding details. In order to participate in the crowd sale the investor must own either Bitcoin or Ether given their dominant market capitalization. In exchange for investing into the blockchain solution investors earn bonus deals which grant them higher number of tokens.
