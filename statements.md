## Premises
* A large population of people _have never heard of cryptocurrency._
* A large population of people who have heard of cryptocurrency _do not know what it is._
* A large population of people who know what cryptocurrency is _do not know how it works._

## Mission Statement
Blockstreet seeks to teach these groups of people how cryptocurrencies work, how they can change the world, and how they can get involved. Our goal is to present information in a way that anyone can understand. We plan to support the written content with visual aids in the form of artwork and animations.

## Vision
Blockstreet aims to become the go-to source for any new users to the blockchain ecosystem. Instead of trying to explain what cryptocurrencies are, existing investors and users refer their friends and loved ones to Blockstreet for a full, yet simple introduction to cryptocurrency. Blockstreet will become an authority on everything blockchain, and perform comprehensive analysis on upcoming initial coin offerings.
