# [What is Cryptocurrency?](#what-is-cryptocurrency)
You might never have seen the word cryptocurrency before, so before we learn about what it is, letâ€™s take a look at the word itself. Crypto is a short way to say cryptography, which is the study of using math to keep something secret and safe. Currency is a fancy way of saying money. So when you put the two together, cryptocurrency is money that is kept safe using math.

## [Where did it all begin?](#the-beginning)
In 2008, a person (or group of people) under the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" wrote a paper describing a digital money system controlled by users of the system with something he called a "Blockchain". The paper also helped create the first cryptocurrency "Bitcoin", which over time has inspired people to create hundreds of other cryptocurrencies.

## [What makes it so exciting?](#why-the-hype)
One of the reasons cryptocurrencies have been getting more popular in the last few years is that they are a type of money that is decentralized. This means that there is no bank that has the final say when it comes to your money.

## [Blockchains](#blockchains)
In order to understand what a cryptocurrency is, it is important to understand what a blockchain is. A blockchain is the technology that allows cryptocurrencies to work. A blockchain is a list of messages where a part of each message is the time the message was sent - like a **<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>** with page numbers. By looking at the last page of this notebook (or the last block in the blockchain), you can tell how much money a person has.

## [Side by Side Comparison](#analogy)
To help understand how cryptocurrencies work, let's pretend there is a person (Alice) owes another person (Bob) $10.  They live in a neighborhood with Carl and Dora, who will help us in the example. On the left Alice pays Bob with a check, on the right she pays him using a crytocurrency.

| Check | Cryptocurrency |
| --- | --- |
| Alice writes a $10 check with Bob's name on the "to" line | Alice writes a note saying that she wants to send Bob $10 |
| Alice gives the check to Bob | Alice posts the note on the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) where everyone can see |
| Alice's bank makes sure that Alice's account has at least $10 in it | Bob, Carl, and Dora all check their copies of the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) to make sure that Alice has at least $10 worth of coins |
| If Alice has enough money, $10 is taken from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not then she is told she doesn't have enough money | If Alice has enough money, Alice, Bob, Carl, and Dora write down in their copies of the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) that $10 worth of coins was taken from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not Alice is told she doesn't have enough money |
