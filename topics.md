## Kevin thoughts
I think this should be our base level education

What is cryptocurrency?
- what do those words mean (crypto and currency)
- quick blurb on nakamoto and bitcoin
- what makes cryptocurrencies cool (really high level - decentralization introduced but not fully explored)
    
What is a blockchain?
  - tech that allows CC to exist (again, really high level - basically just the notebook analogy part)
    
What makes them worth money?
- basic overview of supply and demand

**If** the reader opts into more information on decentralization
- explain more about that

**If** the reader opts into more information on blockchain...
- Digital Signature (as basic as can be - analogy to paper signature)
- Digital Wallet (basic - analogy to home address)
- Mining (basic - explain that there are people who help figure out what the next block should be)
  
**If** the reader opts into more information on digital signatures...
- public key
- private key
 
**If** the reader opts into more information on mining...
- hashing
- proof of stake
- proof of work
  
**If** the reader opts into more information on supply and demand...
- exchanges
  
Not sure where forking fits in, but maybe we can find a place for that.  Everything else I think is not necessarily important enough to include


## Josh's thoughts
I think we can expand out blurb about decentralization a bit more, and get a better example of it

Hashes, soft/hard/forking in general, mining, PoW/PoS and technical terms like those should be briefly discussed , but i don't think we need to go into specifics; treat them like we did digital signatures and public key stuff.

brief descriptions of exchanges could be good for non-stock-market people.

I do not think we need to touch upon the broad, vast field of economics other than a very dumbed down simple explaination of supply and demand.

I thinking lightning network could be an article? I don't know much about it as of now

the "if they want to learn more" sections could be: **topic name**, brief description, example relating it back to real world applications people are familiar with, with a "want to know more?" link at the bottom, which when clicked expands to a more complete section, with links to the actual techinical documentation for whatever they want to know more about.

This "more" section could either be actual paragraphs of information: but do we want to keep makinn git as simple as possible, or actually get into the technical parts? if we get into the technical parts, are we basically just rewriting information that's already written elsewhere that we could link to(a.k.a link to white papers, link to wikipedia articles, etc)

Do we want the education section to read more like a story/article, or a glossary of terms that we try to relate to each other?  I think it would be more digestible as a story/article type section, but we can talk more about this.
