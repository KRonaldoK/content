Kevin thoughts:

I think this should be our base level education
  What is cryptocurrency?
    what do those words mean (crypto and currency)
    quick blurb on nakamoto and bitcoin
    what makes cryptocurrencies cool (really high level - decentralization introduced but not fully explored)
    
  What is a blockchain?
    tech that allows CC to exist (again, really high level - basically just the notebook analogy part)
    
  What makes them worth money?
    basic overview of supply and demand

**If** the reader opts into more information on decentralization
  explain more about that

**If** the reader opts into more information on blockchain...
  Digital Signature (as basic as can be - analogy to paper signature)
  Digital Wallet (basic - analogy to home address)
  Mining (basic - explain that there are people who help figure out what the next block should be)
  
  **If** the reader opts into more information on digital signatures...
    public key
    private key
 
  **If** the reader opts into more information on mining...
    hashing
    proof of stake
    proof of work
  
**If** the reader opts into more information on supply and demand...
  exchanges
  
Not sure where forking fits in, but maybe we can find a place for that.  Everything else I think is not necessarily important enough to include
