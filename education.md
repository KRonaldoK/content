## [Cryptocurrencies](#cryptocurrencies)
In 2008 a person (or group of people), using the name "Satoshi Nakamoto", released a paper describing a digital currency system controlled by every user of the system by using something he called a "Blockchain". This paper also helped create the first cryptocurrency "Bitcoin", which over time has inspired people to create hundreds of other cryptocurrencies.

## [Blockchains](#blockchains)
In order to understand what a cryptocurrency is, it is important to understand what a blockchain is. A blockchain is the technology that allows cryptocurrencies to work. A blockchain is a list of messages where a part of each message is the time the message was sent - like a **<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>** with page numbers. By looking at the last page of this notebook (or the last block in the blockchain), you can tell how much money a person has.

### Useful Terms
There are a few other things that will be helpful to know if you want to understand how transactions work on a blockchain. These things include **digital signatures**, **private keys**, **public keys**, and **digital wallets**.

#### Digital Signature
A digital signature is the same thing for computers that a hand-written signature is for paper - it shows that a person is who they say they are. Cryptocurrencies use digital signatures to make sure that only you can spend money from your account.

#### Private Keys and Public Keys
Private and public keys are the building blocks for **digital signatures**, and their names give us hints about how they are used.  A private (sometimes called secret) key is a key that you keep hidden from everybody else; you use your private key to put your **digital signature** on something.  A public key is a key that you share with the entire world; other people use your public key to make sure that your **digital signature** is actually yours.

#### Digital Wallet
A digital wallet is basically a house for your cryptocurrency. Like a house, every digital wallet has its own addresses, so if people want to pay you money, they know where to send it.

#### Decentralization
One of the reasons cryptocurrencies have been getting more popular in the last few years is that they are a type of money that is decentralized. This means that there is no part of the system that has more information or power than any other part. Think of it like playing poker at a table where any player can see the chips that every other player has, and everybody's cards are face up - if you try to lie, everyone will know. Most cryptocurrencies are based on decentralized systems.

## [Side by Side Comparison](#analogy)
Let's pretend there is a person (Alice) owes another person (Bob) $10.  They live in a neighborhood with Carl and Dora, who will help us in the example. On the left Alice pays Bob with a check, on the right she pays him using a crytocurrency.

| Check | Cryptocurrency |
| --- | --- |
| Alice writes a $10 check with Bob's name on the "to" line | Alice writes a note saying that her **digital wallet** address wants to send $10 worth of coins to Bob's **digital wallet** address |
| Alice signs the check in cursive, using a pen | Alice uses her **private key** to sign put her **digital signature** on her note  |
| Alice gives the check to Bob | Alice posts the note on the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) where everyone can see |
| Alice's bank makes sure that the signature on the check matches the signature they have on file for her | Bob, Carl, and Dora use Alice's **public key** to make sure that the note was written by Alice |
| Alice's bank makes sure that Alice's account has at least $10 in it | Bob, Carl, and Dora all check their copies of the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) to make sure that Alice has at least $10 worth of coins |
| If Alice has enough money, $10 is taken from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not then she is told she doesn't have enough money | If Alice has enough money, Alice, Bob, Carl, and Dora write down in their copies of the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) that $10 worth of coins was taken from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not Alice is told she doesn't have enough money |

One thing you may have noticed in the left hand column is that we are putting a lot of trust into the bank. That is because the way we use money now is a centralized system, where the bank has the final say in how much money people have. If the bank makes a mistake, decides to steal people's money, or somehow forgets how much money people have, then anyone who trusted the bank could lose their money. 
The right hand column is uses a money system that is decentralized, which means a record of how much money people have is copied by every member of the neighborhood. If Alice tries to say that she has more money than she really does, then Bob, Carl, and Dora will know that she is lying. If Carl's blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) is lost or ruined somehow, he can just ask Alice, Bob, or Dora to show him their copy, and Carl can get his lost blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) back.

## [Efficiency](#efficiency)
Even though the decentralized system from the example above might look better than the way that uses a bank, you might think "If I have to tell every person about every transaction, that could take a long time. Wouldn't that make things really slow?".

Thanks to computers, all of this can be done quickly and automatically without you ever needing to do anything. Since computers are getting faster all the time, Alice can do all of the steps in the right hand column above in less than a second!


## [What makes it valuable?](#what-makes-it-valuable)
You may be wondering how cryptocurrencies are worth real money. Let's break it down using a familiar example.

**The US Dollar**: a currency used to buy things in the United States. A dollar is simply a piece of paper with some numbers on it. What makes it worth anything more than a cryptocurrency? You may be thinking, "isn't the dollar backed by gold?", but you'd be wrong. It hasn't been backed by gold since [1934](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12770.htm). But to keep it simple, lets pretend we took a small trip back in time. Gold has **<lookup key="intrinsic-value">intrinsic value</lookup>**. It can be made into jewelry, it's conductive, so it can be used in electrical stuff (such as your computer or smartphone) yet doesn't rust, unlike copper. While it is possible to make gold, the amount of money that it costs is more than the money you could get from selling it, which means there is a limited amount of it. These reasons show why gold has value. But what about cryptocurrencies?

#### Are cryptocurrencies a limited resource?
For most cryptocurrencies, there is a limited number of "coins" that can be available at any given time. You can't simply "create" a bitcoin and add it to your wallet, due to cryptography and transaction logging. Coins are currently created by "miners" who form the backbone of any cyptocurrency.  Mining often requires much more computing power than the average person has access to, but fortunately for us, we do not need to be a miner in order to use cryptocurrency.
  
#### Do they have intrinsic value?
Well, yes and no. For example, Bitcoin can be seen as a "store of value" with its price being depending on supply and demand. The more people that think bitcoins are worth something, the more people buy into it and the price goes up. Other forms of cryptocurrencies may have value because their blockchains provide the capability to run "smart contracts" which are a list of actions that run according to a plan. Smart contracts are a new concept but they are believed to provide safe ways of ensuring that two or more parties hold up their end of a bargain. For instance, a smart contract could be made to automatically pay the pizza company when the delivery man drops off the pizza.  If the pizza never arrives, then the company never gets paid. But if the pizza does arrive, then the customer cannot take the pizza and refuse to pay.
  
## [Who buys cryptocurrencies?](#who-buys-cryptocurrencies)
There are a lot of different people who buy cryptocurrencies. There are many currencies, each trying to solve existing problems of the centralized systems, or create new applications using blockchain technology.

#### Day Traders
Just like in the stock market there are people who want to profit from the changing prices of cryptocurrencies. They purchase a currency when the price is low and sell it when the price is high. Many cryptocurrencies change price much more quickly than stocks and are able to gain or lose over 20% of their value in a single day. This makes for a very profitable outcome if a trader is able to time the market ups and downs.

#### Holders
Some people believe that cryptocurrencies will change the way people do online banking. They believe that eventually, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will become common, and used for everything from paying your electricity bill to buying food at a restaurant. By buying now at a discounted price, they think the value of their currency will go up as more people use it.

#### Corporations
Some cryptocurrencies have drawn interest from large companies; Microsoft, Santander, and JP Morgan (to name a few) are interested in a cryptocurrency called Ethereum. These companies may try to use blockchain technology to make certain operations more efficient and take advantage of the fast transaction speed, resulting in cheaper operational costs.

## [What are some examples of cryptocurrencies?](#what-are-some-examples-of-cryptocurrencies)
#### Bitcoin
Bitcoin was the first kind of money to be based on a blockchain. It lets people pay one another just like with paper bills or credit cards, and has been built to make sure that money cannot be lost or stolen. Bitcoin is listed in cryptocurrency exchange sites as BTC, and has a stock supply (usually called coins or tokens). Unlike most other forms of money, these coins can be broken down into smaller parts so that you can pay someone with fractions of coins. A coin can represent almost anything, but usually coins are used to represent dollars. As of March 2017 each coin is worth $1,059 giving it a $17.2B market capitalization.

#### Ethereum
Ethereum is a cryptocurrency that was made to run "smart contracts". A smart contract is a computer program that, once it starts, cannot be stopped until it has run all the way through. This idea can be used for many different applications; from paying for a taxi ride to giving away money in a will. Like Bitcoin it was built on a blackchain to make sure that security is a number one priority. Smart contracts are made with a special programming language and are run on a browser called Mist. It has the 2nd largest market capitalization (valued at $3.74B).

#### Dash
Dash is another cryptocurrency that was made to be used as digital cash. Dash uses technologies built by other cryptocurrencies to try to be the most secure and the fastest cryptocurrency there is. Dash uses many strategies to make sure that every transaction is as secure as possible. Dash also focuses on making its product easy to use. Purchases from websites or mobile apps using Dash should be simple, sometimes needing only a single click.
