***Note:** This is a constantly expanding portion of the site that will grow in both content and clarity over time.*

## [Cryptocurrencies](#cryptocurrencies)
In 2008, a person (or group of people) under the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" released a paper describing a digital currency system controlled by every user of the system by using something he called a "Blockchain". This paper also created the first cryptocurrency "Bitcoin", and inspired people to create hundreds of other cryptocurrencies.

## [Blockchains](#blockchains)
We just used the word "blockchain", but if nobody has ever explained it to you, you might be wondering what it is. Blockchain is the technology that allows cryptocurrencies to work. It is basically a list of messages where a part of each message is the time the message was sent - kinda like a notebook with page numbers. For Bitcoin, the blockchain is a (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**). By looking at this notebook (blockchain), you can tell how much money a person has.

### Useful Terms
There are a few things you'll need to know to understand how transactions work on a blockchain. You'll need to know about **<lookup key="digital-signature">digital signatures</lookup>**, **<lookup key="private-key">private keys</lookup>**, **<lookup key="public-key">public keys</lookup>**, and **<lookup key="digital-wallet">digital wallets</lookup>**.

#### Digital Signature
A digital signature is the same thing for computers that a hand-written signature is for paper - it shows that a person is who they say they are. Whenever you see "digital signature", just think **<lookup key="computer-signature">computer signature</lookup>**.

#### Private and Public Keys
Private and public keys are the building blocks for **<lookup key="computer-signature">computer signatures</lookup>**, and their names will help us understand how they are used.  A private (or secret) key is a key that you keep hidden from everybody else; you use your private key to put your **<lookup key="computer-signature">computer signature</lookup>** on something.  A public key is a key that you share with the entire world; other people use your public key to make sure that your **<lookup key="computer-signature">computer signature</lookup>** is actually yours.

#### Digital Wallet
A digital wallet is basically a house for your cryptocurrency.  Every digital wallet has its own addresses, so if people want to pay you money, they know where to send it.

#### Decentralization
If a system is decentralized, that means that every person in the system knows everything about it. Think of it like playing poker at a table where any player can see the chips that every other player has, and everybody's cards are face up - if you try to lie, everyone will know. Most cryptocurrencies are based on decentralized systems.

## [Analogy Time](#analogy-time)
Let's consider the scenario where a person (Alice) owes another person (Bob) $10.  They live in a neighborhood with Carl and Dora, who will help us in the example.  On the left Alice pays Bob with a check, on the right she pays him using crytocurrency.

<div class="table-anchor">

| Check | Cryptocurrency |
| --- | --- |
| Alice writes a $10 check with Bob's name on the "to" line | Alice writes a note saying that her **<lookup key="digital-wallet">digital wallets</lookup>** address wants to send $10 worth of coins to Bob's **<lookup key="digital-wallet">digital wallets</lookup>** address |
| Alice signs the check in cursive, using a pen | Alice uses her **<lookup key="private-key">private keys</lookup>** to sign put her **<lookup key="computer-signature">digital signature</lookup>** on her note  |
| Alice gives the check to Bob | Alice posts the note on the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) where everyone can see |
| Alice's bank makes sure that the signature on the check matches the signature they have on file for her | Bob, Carl, and Dora use Alice's **<lookup key="public-key">public key</lookup>** to make sure that the note was written by Alice |
| Alice's bank makes sure that Alice's account has at least $10 in it | Bob, Carl, and Dora all check their copies of the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) to make sure that Alice has at least $10 worth of coins |
| If Alice has enough money, $10 is taken from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not then she is told she doesn't have enough money | If Alice has enough money, Alice, Bob, Carl, and Dora write down in their copies of the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) that $10 worth of coins was taken from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not Alice is told she doesn't have enough money |

</div>

One thing you may have noticed in the left hand column is that we are putting a lot of trust into the bank. If the bank makes a mistake, decides to be a jerk, or somehow forgets how much money people have then anyone who trusted in the bank could lose their money. In the right hand column all of the records are copied by every member of the neighborhood. If Alice tries to say that she has more money than she really does then Bob, Carl, and Dora will know that she is lying. If Carl's blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) is lost or ruined somehow, he can just ask Alice, Bob, or Dora to show him their copy, and Carl can get his lost blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) back.

## [Efficiency](#efficiency)
Even though the decentralized steps from the above example look better than the way that uses a bank, you might think "If I have to tell every person about every transaction, that could take a long time. Wouldn't that make things really slow?".

Thanks to computer programs, all of this can be done quickly and automatically without you ever needing to do anything. Since computers are getting faster all the time, Alice can do all of the steps in the right hand column above in less than a second!


## [What makes it valuable?](#what-makes-it-valuable)
You may be wondering how bits on the computer can possibly be worth anything at all. Lets break it down using a familiar example.

**The US Dollar**: a currency used to buy things in the United States. A dollar is simply a piece of paper with some numbers on it. What makes it worth anything more than a cryptocurrency? You may be thinking, "isn't the dollar backed by gold?", but you'd be wrong. It hasn't been backed by gold since [1934](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12770.htm). But to keep it simple, lets pretend we took a small trip back in time. Gold has **<lookup key="intrinsic-value">intrinsic value</lookup>**. It can be made into jewelry, it's conductive, so it can be used in electrical stuff (such as your computer or smartphone) yet doesn't rust, unlike copper. While it is possible to make gold, the amount of money that it costs is more than the money you could get from selling it, which means there is a limited amount of it. These reasons show why gold has value. But what about cryptocurrencies?

#### Are cryptocurrencies a limited resource?
For most cryptocurrencies, there is a limited number of "coins" that can be available at any given time. You can't simply "create" a bitcoin and add it to your wallet, due to cryptography and transaction logging. Coins are currently created by "miners" who form the backbone of any cyptocurrency.  Mining often requires much more computing power than the average person has access to, but fortunately for us, we do not need to be a miner in order to use cryptocurrency.
  
#### Do they have intrinsic value?
Well, yes and no. For example, Bitcoin can be seen as a "store of value" with its price being depending on supply and demand. The more people that think bitcoins are worth something, the more people buy into it and the price goes up. Other forms of cryptocurrencies may have value because their blockchains provide the capability to run "smart contracts" which are a list of actions that run according to a plan. Smart contracts are a new concept but they are believed to provide safe ways of ensuring that two or more parties hold up their end of a bargain. For instance, a smart contract could be made to automatically pay the pizza company when the delivery man drops off the pizza.  If the pizza never arrives, then the company never gets paid. But if the pizza does arrive, then the customer cannot take the pizza and refuse to pay.
  
## [Who buys cryptocurrencies?](#who-buys-cryptocurrencies)
There are a lot of different people who buy cryptocurrencies. There are many currencies, each trying to solve existing problems of the centralized systems, or create new applications using blockchain technology.

#### Day Traders
Just like in the stock market there are people who want to profit from the changing prices of cryptocurrencies. They purchase a currency when the price is low and sell it when the price is high. Many cryptocurrencies change price much more quickly than stocks and are able to gain or lose over 20% of their value in a single day. This makes for a very profitable outcome if a trader is able to time the market ups and downs.

#### Holders
Some people believe that cryptocurrencies will change the way people do online banking. They believe that eventually, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will become common, and used for everything from paying your electricity bill to buying food at a restaurant. By buying now at a discounted price, they think the value of their currency will go up as more people use it.

#### Corporations
Some cryptocurrencies have drawn interest from large companies; Microsoft, Santander, and JP Morgan (to name a few) are interested in a cryptocurrency called Ethereum. These companies may try to use blockchain technology to make certain operations more efficient and take advantage of the fast transaction speed, resulting in cheaper operational costs.

## [What are some examples of cryptocurrencies?](#what-are-some-examples-of-cryptocurrencies)
#### Bitcoin
Bitcoin was the first kind of money to be based on a blockchain. It lets people pay one another just like with paper bills or credit cards, and has been built to make sure that money cannot be lost or stolen. Bitcoin is listed in cryptocurrency exchange sites as BTC, and has a stock supply (usually called coins or tokens). Unlike most other forms of money, these coins can be broken down into smaller parts so that you can pay someone with fractions of coins. A coin can represent almost anything, but usually coins are used to represent dollars. As of March 2017 each coin is worth $1,059 giving it a $17.2B market capitalization.

#### Ethereum
Ethereum is a cryptocurrency that was made to run "smart contracts". A smart contract is a computer program that, once it starts, cannot be stopped until it has run all the way through. This idea can be used for many different applications; from paying for a taxi ride to giving away money in a will. Like Bitcoin it was built on a blackchain to make sure that security is a number one priority. Smart contracts are made with a special programming language and are run on a browser called Mist. It has the 2nd largest market capitalization (valued at $3.74B).

#### Dash
Dash is another cryptocurrency that was made to be used as digital cash. Dash uses technologies built by other cryptocurrencies to try to be the most secure and the fastest cryptocurrency there is. Dash uses many strategies to make sure that every transaction is as secure as possible. Dash also focuses on making its product easy to use. Purchases from websites or mobile apps using Dash should be simple, sometimes needing only a single click.

## [How do people get cryptocurrencies?](#how-do-people-get-cryptocurrencies)
People get cryptocurrencies similar to how they get regular, phsyical money. In order to get physical money, such as USD(United States Dollar), people usually trade goods or services to receive it.  But where does the money come from?  For USD, our government prints it out to replace lost/destroyed money, and the Federal Reserve loans it out to banks.  But how do people get cryptocurrencies?

#### Trading for goods or services
Some people treat cryptocurrencies very similar to physical money, and trade it for goods or services.  For example, every day there are more and more websites that accept some cryptocurrencies(such at Bitcoin) as a payment. It's similar to making a purchase with PayPal. A person can a website willing to accept Bitcoins, then trade then for physical goods, such as new clothes or a tv. One such site where you can spend your bitcoin is [Overstock.com](https://overstock.com), where you can buy thousands of different products.
You can also spend bitcoins to recieve services form someone else. For example, there are sites like [Steem](https://steem.io/) which allow you to earn cryptocurrency buy posting good content that other people enjoy. Many writers or journalists online will have a link to their wallet, where you can send them cryptocurrency if you enjoyed their writing.

#### Buying with physical money
It's also possible to trade your USD, along with some other physical currencies, for cryptocurrencies using Exchanges. Sites like [GDAX](https://gdax.com) or [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com) let people put up their cryptocurrencies for sale on a market, and you can buy them with physical money. These sites have some more complex features, like limit orders, stop losses, and other terms used in the stock market which allow you to be very specific for how you buy or sell cryptocurrencies.

You can also use sites like [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com) to purchase or sell cryptocurrencies. This site in particular allows you to look through a list of advertisements from traders, and see their history and reviews. When you find someone you trustworthy who's selling something you want, you can set a meeting time and place to meet up with them and trade them cash. Once you do, the cryptocurrency is then deposited in your account.

[Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) is a popular way for US residents to purchase two of the top cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. You can make an account and upload your driver's license to get verified, then make purchases using a credit card or a bank account. You must first verify your credit card annd bank account, which can take several days. After you do, you can make instant purchases with your credit card, or make higher limit purchases with a bank transfer.  When using the bank transfer option, the price of ethereum is locked in when you make the purchase, but it may take a week or so for the Ethereum to arrive in your account.  While you are waiting for it to get to your account, you can not spend it. This option is best for those who plan to buy and hold onto their money, because you are unable to resell it quickly if you are trying ot cut your losses, or make some money if the price jumps up soon after you buy it.

#### Mining
As I said before, the government(in the United States, specifically the Treasury Department) is responsible for printing new money.  So how does "new cryptocurrency" come into existence? For now, the answer is mining.

How does mining work? Well, it's a little complicated to explain the specifics, so here's a simplified version. Remember the blockchain, also known as the **<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**? Someone needs to be writing all the transactions down, and distributing the notebook to everyone, and that's where miners come in. The miner's computers do very difficult, complex math problems that take a long time to solve. They all attempt the same problem at the same time; when one of the miner's computers solves the problem, the rest of the miners verify it, and a block of transactions is added to the blockchain. Because mining takes a lot of computational power, and electricity, it costs some money to do. To reward them, miners get to add a transaction onto the block they solve, giving themselves a certain amount of cryptocurrency. This is a standard amount, and over time the reward gets smaller and smaller. For many cryptocurrencies, this is the only way new cryptocurrencies get introduced.
