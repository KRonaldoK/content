## [Cryptocurrencies](#cryptocurrencies)
In 2008, a person (or group of people) under the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" released a paper describing a digital currency system controlled by every user of the system by using something he called a "Blockchain". This paper also created the first cryptocurrency "Bitcoin", and inspired people to create hundreds of other cryptocurrencies.

## [Blockchains](#blockchains)
We've said the term "blockchain" before, so you might be wondering what it is. A blockchain is the underlying technology that allows cryptocurrencies to work. It is a record of all the transactions that have ever been made between people on the network. By looking at this ledger(blockchain), you can tell how much money any individual person has.

### Useful Terms
There are a few terms you'll need to know to understand how transactions work on a blockchain. You'll need to know about **digital signatures**, **public and private keys**, and **digital wallets**.

#### Digital Signature
A digital signature is the same thing for computers that a hand-written signature is for paper - it shows that a person is who they say they are. Whenever you see "digital signature", just think **computer signature**.

#### Private and Public Keys
Private and public keys are the building blocks for **computer signatures**, and their names help us understand how they are used.  A private (or secret) key is a key that you keep hidden from everybody else; you use your private key to put your **computer signature** on something.  A public key is a key that you share with the entire world; other people use your public key to make sure that your **computer signature** is actually yours.

#### Digital Wallet
A digital wallet is basically the same thing as a bank account.  Digital wallets have unique addresses to identify them, similar to a checking account's account number and routing number.

#### Decentralization
A decentralized system is one where no one person is the source of truth.  In a decentralized system, every person has access to every bit of information that is available.  Think of it like playing poker at a table where any player can see the chips that every other player has.  Most cryptocurrencies are based on decentralized systems.

## [Analogy Time](#analogy)
Let's consider the scenario where a person (Alice) owes another person (Bob) $10.  They live in a neighborhood with Carl and Dora, who will make appearances later on.  On the left Alice pays Bob with a check, on the right she pays him using crytocurrency

| Check | Cryptocurrency |
| --- | --- |
| Alice writes a $10 check with Bob's name on the "to" line | Alice writes a note saying that her **digital wallet** address wants to send $10 worth of coins to Bob's wallet address |
| Alice signs the check in cursive, using a pen | Alice uses her **digital signature** to sign her note using her **private key** |
| Alice gives the check to Bob | Alice posts the note on the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) where everyone can see |
| Alice's bank makes sure that the signature on the check matches the signature they have on file for her | Bob, Carl, and Dora use Alice's **public key** to verify that the note was written by Alice |
| Alice's bank makes sure that Alice's account has at least $10 in it | Bob, Carl, and Dora all check their copies of the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) to make sure that Alice has at least $10 worth of coins |
| If Alice has enough money, $10 is deducted from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not, the she is told she doesn't have enough money | If Alice has enough money, Alice, Bob, Carl, and Dora note in their copies of the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) that $10 worth of coins were deducted from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not, Alice is told she doesn't have enough money |

One thing you may have noticed in the left hand column is that we are putting a lot of trust into the bank.  If the bank makes a mistake, decides to be a jerk, or loses its data somehow, anyone who put their trust in the bank could lose their money.  In the right hand column, all of the records are copied by every member of the neighborhood.  If Alice tries to claim that she has more money than she really does, Bob, Carl, and Dora will know that she is lying.  If Carl's blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**) is destroyed somehow, he can simply ask Alice, Bob, or Dora to show him their copy, and Carl can recover his lost blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook of transactions</lookup>**), because they all have the same information.

## [Efficiency](#efficiency)
While the decentralized approach from the above example may look like an improvement from the initial centralized approach we started with, you might think "Hmm, having to tell every single person about every transaction could get messy. Wouldn't this system be slow?" A member of the community telling everyone whenever they want to make a transaction seems like an inefficient way of doing things.

Thanks to technology, all of this informing, book-keeping and verification can be done quickly and automatically by a user's computer. Given the ever increasing speed at which computers can process data, the transactions and record-keeping are nearly instant. This can allow the system to scale to worldwide, instead of the small community.


## [What makes it valuable?](#what-makes-it-valuable)
You may be wondering how bits on the computer can possibly be worth anything at all. Lets break it down using a familiar example.

**The US Dollar**: a currency used to buy things in the United States. A dollar is simply a piece of paper with some numbers on it. What makes it worth anything more than a cryptocurrency? You may be thinking, "isn't the dollar backed by gold?", but you'd be wrong. It hasn't been backed by gold since [1934](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12770.htm). But to keep it simple, lets pretend we took a small trip back in time. Gold has **<lookup key="intrinsic-value">intrinsic value</lookup>**. It can be made into jewelry, it's conductive, so it can be used in electrical stuff(such as your computer or smartphone), yet doesn't rust, unlike copper. There is also a limited amount of gold; while you **can** make gold, the amount of money it costs to make gold is more than the amount of money you could get by selling the created gold. These reasons show why gold has value. But what about cryptocurrencies?

#### Are cryptocurrencies a limited resource?
For most cryptocurrencies, there is a limited number of "coins" that can be available at any given time. You can't simply "create" a bitcoin and add it to your wallet, due to cryptography and transaction logging. Coins are currently created by "miners" who form the backbone of any cyptocurrency.  Mining often requires much more computing power than the average person has access to, but fortunately for us, we do not need to be a miner in order to use cryptocurrency.
  
#### Do they have intrinsic value?
Well, yes and no. For example, Bitcoin can be seen as a "store of value", with its price being depending on supply and demand. The more people that think bitcoins are worth something, the more people buy into it, and the price goes up. Other forms of cryptocurrencies may have value because their blockchains provide the capability to run "smart contracts", which are a list of actions that run according to a plan. Smart contracts are a new concept, but they are believed to provide safe ways of ensuring that two or more parties hold up their end of a bargain. For instance, a smart contract could be made to automatically pay the pizza company when the delivery man drops off the pizza.  If the pizza never arives, the company never gets paid, but if the pizza does arive, the customer cannot take the pizza and refuse to pay.
  
## [Who buys cryptocurrencies?](#who-buys-cryptocurrencies)
There are lots of different people who buy cryptocurrencies. There are many currencies, each trying to solve existing problems of the centralized systems, or create new applications using blockchain technology.

#### Day Traders
Just like in the stock market, there are people who want to profit from the changing prices of cryptocurrencies. They purchase a currency when the price is low, and sell it when the price is high. Many cryptocurrencies change price much more quickly than stocks, and are able to gain or lose over 20% of their value in a single day. This makes for a very profitable outcome if a trader is able to time the market ups and downs.

#### Holders
Some people believe that cryptocurrencies will change the way people do online banking. They believe that eventually, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will become common, and used for everything from paying your electricity bill to buying food at a restaurant. By buying now at a discounted price, they think the value of their currency will go up as more people use it.

#### Corporations
Some cryptocurrencies have drawn interest from large companies; Microsoft, Santander, and JP Morgan (to name a few) are interested in a cryptocurrency called Ethereum. These companies may try to use blockchain technology to make certain operations more efficient and take advantage of the fast transaction speed, resulting in cheaper operational costs.

## [What are some examples of cryptocurrencies?](#what-are-some-examples-of-cryptocurrencies)
#### Bitcoin
Bitcoin is blockchain's first digital asset referred to as cryptocurrency. Its an innovative payment solution powered by blockchain technology. It acts as a peer to peer cash payment system and a storage of value with security built at its core. It was the first payment solution to solve the double-spend problem after the crash of 2008. Double-spending is the result of successfully spending some money more than once. Bitcoin, as seen on exchanges as (BTC) has a stock supply, generally called coins or tokens, of 21,000,000BTC which are divisible by 100M units per coin. Each unit is uniquely identifiable and programmable allowing users to assign custom properties to each unit. A unit can represent a USD, a share in a company, a KwH of energy, a digital certificate of ownership, 1,000 barrels of oil, loyalty credits or electoral votes. As of March 2017 each coin is worth $1,059 giving it a $17.2B market capitalization. Bitcoin leverages the blockchains open sourced codebase, referred to as an open API (application program interface) and created its own API allowing innovators to leverage its payment network for transacting and engineering new use cases.

#### Ethereum
Ethereum is a decentralized digital contracts system. It is the first large scale computer allowing applications to run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference. It has the potential to be a secure backbone for everything from e-commerce to IoT enabling transparent governing systems for communities and businesses. It handles user authentication, security, messaging and decentralized storage of data. Digital contracts are programmed rules that are enforced by Ethereums underlying core code which sits on top of the Blockchain and leverages portions of Bitcoins code. The programming is done with a programming laneguage which is executed on a browser called Mist. This allows developers who are knowledgable in Java, C, Python to program "smart contracts". It has the 2nd largest market cap valued at $3.74B. It has the potential to be the next evolution of the worldwide web.

#### Dash
Dash is easy to use digital cash for instant, private and secure transactions. Dash does this by leveraging several existing blockchain solutions such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Lightning Network which provides a faster way to transact. Dash automatically provides different sending and receiving address for every transaction all the while allowing each user to retain a private encrypted account authentication code that only they know. Dash’s premier technology Evolution make’s digital cash easy to use and access for all users, even those who aren’t technologically savvy. Anybody will be able to setup an account on the blockchain, add contacts and pay them by name. Purchases from websites or mobile apps will be simple, requiring only a single click. It is comparable to that of PayPal for blockchain. It enables the access of digital cash on any computer eliminating the need to store and access digital currency on one and only one device.
