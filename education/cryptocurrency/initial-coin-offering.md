# Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)
Many blockchain projects and companies are raising capital via cryptocurrency crowdfunding, popularly known as 'initial coin offerings' (or ICOs). Similar to initial public offerings (IPOs) for the stock market, investors provide early funding to a new project or company in exchange for a pre-determined amount of shares (or coins). Once the project or company's coin is officially launched, coins are distributed to investors and can be traded on exchanges. ICOs can be advantageous since companies, projects, or ideas can be funded significantly quicker than traditional methods.
 
#### How does one participate in an ICO?
Participating in an ICO is a fairly simple endeavor considering projects looking to crowdsource funding can differ in their requirements and approach. 
#### Example
A new project named 'NewCoin' is raising funding through an ICO and an investor named John would like to participate. 

NewCoin prepares their ICO with a set launch date and time window to raise funds. During this time, John is required to create a NewCoin wallet for the newly formed cryptocurrency and be prepared to exchange his bitcoin or ethereum for NewCoins if he wishes to participate. John can see on NewCoin's ICO webpage that 1000 NewCoin = 0.01 Bitcoin, with a limit of purchasing no more than 10,000 NewCoin per individual. John decides to buy 2000 NewCoin and thus sends 0.02 Bitcoin from his personal Bitcoin wallet to NewCoin's address. The ICO closes several days later, and NewCoin officially launches their new cryptocurrency. John's 2000 NewCoins are automatically deposited into his wallet and ready to be used.  

#### Why do individuals invest in ICOs?
ICOs are intriguing to investors since their investment is both a way to support an open-source project and capitalize on the cryptocurrency's potential increase in value. Some of the most appealing ICOs offer aspirational solutions to societal problems such as the [Humaniq](https://humaniq.co/?_ga=2.129434761.488867700.1493844992-998258822.1493844750) project, whose mission is to offer a secure and simple banking tool for people who cannot hold a bank account due to lack of education or lack of identification. Others like [Kin](https://kin.kik.com/#Newsletter) (by the popular messaging company Kik) are designed to be used for everyday digital services like payment.
 
#### Regulation & Standards
While new ICOs are launched often, standards and government regulation of the crowdfunding activity is largely undefined today. This has left citizens of many countries, including the United States, unable to participate in ICOs. Additionally, many ICOs set rules when raising money, including a cap on the amount of money they wish to raise and strictly receiving Bitcoin or Ethereum as the only exchanged currency for investment.

#### Where can I find upcoming ICOs?
Upcoming ICOs can be found on sites such as [ICO Countdown](http://www.icocountdown.com/). It is important to note that investors commonly research, analyze, and speak to members of the company or project launching the ICO before investing.
