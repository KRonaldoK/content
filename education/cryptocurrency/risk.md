## Cryptocurrency Risk

For bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies, investment risk is very similar to that of a public stock. Risk boils down to three main categories: education, price stability, and coin security. 

### Education Importance
Education of how cryptocurrency technology works, how one coin is unique from others, and what changes to a cryptocurrency blockchain may occur are all important factors before investing. Just like analyzing a company before investing in their stock, investors should thoroughly analyze a cryptocurrency and understand what makes an investment in one coin better than another. Areas of consideration may be:
- Coin Price
- Coin Features
- Applicable Use Cases
- Scalability
- External or Enterprise Support
- Coin Resources & Skill

### Price Stability
While cryptocurrencies differ in supply (limited or unlimited), price stability is largely dependent on supply and demand on trading exchanges as well as an individuals' ability to buy or sell a significant amount of one coin. Since cryptocurrencies differ in design when first launched, investors should consider attributes like coin supply caps and amount of coins the founders are holding (or releasing at a later date) for project advancement purposes. Just like fiat currencies, prices are also impacted by factors outside of the cryptocurrency's control such as major news and announcements, or the coin's dependence on another cryptocurrency.

### Coin Security
How an individual stores and secures his or her cryptocurrencies also determines investment risk. Those who are knowledgable about blockchain technology may increase coin security by ensuring their coins are saved locally on their computer using password-protected wallets. Passive investors however may leave their coins on an exchange wallet and treat the coin like  stock sitting in an E-Trade account. Although exchanges are becoming more reliable and user-friendly, investors should understand that exchanges facilitate an enormous amount of fiat currency and cryptocurrency on a dialy basis. Therefore, exchanges are prone to higher security threats like other money transmitters and alternative storage methods such as local hard drive wallets can be pursued.
