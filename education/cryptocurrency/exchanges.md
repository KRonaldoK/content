# Exchanges
There are several ways to get cryptocurrency using United States Dollars (USD). No matter which way you choose, there is a person who wants to trade their cryptocurrency for your dollars. People have established million-dollar companies that specialize in bringing together buyers and sellers on their platform. These companies (called exchanges) charge a percentage of the transaction for their services.

Using these services often requires you to verify your identity to comply with Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer laws(AML/KYC laws). To transfer funds to these exchanges, you will need to link a bank account, credit card, or debit card. Usually the exchange makes two small deposits to your account and asks you how much they were to confirm that the account is indeed yours. Afterwards you can purchase the cryptocurrrencies offered by that exchange.

## Trading Platforms
Trading platforms are exchanges that give their users more flexibility when it comes to exchange rates by offering limit and market orders. These platforms are used by day traders and long term holders to move their assets from currency to currency, capitalizing on the small changes in price or buying/selling at specific prices.

## Exchange Wallets
Exchange wallets are a simplified version of trading platforms. Their purpose is to allow users to buy cryptocurrency at the market rate using one of many payment methods. Bank wires, ACH transfers, and credit / debit card purchases are all allowed to make it as easy as possible to buy cryptocurrency. Purchases made are made at the market price instead of a rate specified by the user. Fees are usually higher for both buy and selling from exchange wallets.

These wallets give people the ability to buy cryptocurrency without having money in the exchange. Instead the wallet uses money directly from from the buyer's bank account.

## Local Trading
You can also use sites to buy or sell cryptocurrencies in person. This site allows you to look through a list of advertisements from traders, and see their history and reviews. When you find someone you trustworthy who's selling the cryptocurrency you want, you can set a time and place to meet up with them, and trade them cash. Once you do, the cryptocurrency is then deposited in your account.
