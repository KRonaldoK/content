# Exchanges
There are several ways to get cryptocurrency using United States Dollars (USD). No matter what way you use, the common theme is there is another person who wishes to trade their cryptocurrency for your dollars. The exchange rate of how many dollars you have to pay for the cryptocurrency you want is a constantly fluctuating number. People have established million-dollar companies that specialize in bringing together buyers and sellers on their platform. These companies charge a percentage of the transaction for their services.

Using these services often requires you to verify your identity to satisfy government regulations. To transfer funds to these exchanges, you will need to link a bank account, credit card, or debit card. Usually the exchange will make two micro-deposits to your account so you may confirm that the account is indeed yours. Afterwards you may purchase the cryptocurrrencies offered by that exchange up to a specified limit, which increases over time and use. These measures are all in place to prevent fraud and protect the exchange.

## Trading Platforms
Trading platforms are exchanges that give their users full flexibility when it comes to bartering exchange rates through limit and market orders. These platforms are used by day traders to move their assets from currency to currency, capitalizing on the small changes in price.

## Wallets
Wallets are a simplified version of trading platforms. Their primary purpose is to allow users to purchase cryptocurrency directly at the market rate using several different payment methods. Bank wires, ACH transfers, and credit / debit card purchases are all supported to make it as easy as possible to purchase cryptocurrency. Purchases made are done at the market rate, and not at a rate specified by the user. Fees also tend to be higher for both purchases, and moving money in and out.

These wallets give users the ability to purchase cryptocurrency without having funds present in the exchange. When purchasing this way, the exchange makes a request to your bank for the funds required for the purchase. They then purchase the cryptocurrency off the market at the current price and hold it in reserve until they receive funds from your bank, at time of which you are given the cryptocurrency.

## Local Trading
You can also use sites to purchase or sell cryptocurrencies in person. This site in particular allows you to look through a list of advertisements from traders, and see their history and reviews. When you find someone you trustworthy who's selling the cryptocurrency you want, you can set a time and place to meet up with them, and trade them cash. Once you do, the cryptocurrency is then deposited in your account.
