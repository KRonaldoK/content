# Exchanges
There are several ways to get cryptocurrency using fiat like US Dollars (USD). No matter which way you choose, there is a person who wants to trade their cryptocurrency for your dollars. Companies (called exchanges) specialize in bringing together buyers and sellers on their platform and charge a small fee for their services.

Using these services often requires you to verify your identity to comply with Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer laws (AML/KYC laws). To transfer funds to these exchanges, you will need to link a bank account, credit card, or debit card.

## Trading Platforms
Trading platforms are exchanges that give their users more flexibility when it comes to exchange rates by offering limit and market orders. These platforms are used by day traders and long term holders to move their money from currency to currency and to try to take advantage small changes in price to make money.

## Exchange Wallets
Exchange wallets are a simplified version of trading platforms. They allow users to buy cryptocurrency at the market rate using one of many payment methods. Depending on the Exchange, bank wires, ACH transfers, and credit / debit card purchases are all allowed to make it as easy as possible to buy cryptocurrency. Purchases made are made at the market price instead of a rate specified by the user. Fees are usually higher for both buying and selling from exchange wallets.

Exchange wallets let people buy cryptocurrency without having money in an exchange. Instead the wallet uses money directly from from the buyer's bank account.

## Local Trading
You can also use sites to buy or sell cryptocurrencies in person. These sites allow you to look through a list of advertisements from traders, and see their history and reviews. When you find someone trustworthy who's selling the cryptocurrency you want, you can set a time and place to meet up with them, and trade them cash. Once you do, the cryptocurrency is then deposited in your account.
