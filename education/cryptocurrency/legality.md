# Legality
 
## Are bitcoin and digital currencies legal?
 
The short answer is yes. The use and trade of bitcoin is legal in all but a few countries today however its treatment as money or a commodity differs drastically depending on location. While governments are still in an exploratory and educational stage with digital currencies, they have made sure to warn the public of the risks involved in using, investing, or trading.
 
## United States
 
Although most countries have no regulation around bitcoin or digital currencies, the United States has been among the first to classify bitcoin within their legal framework and provide guidelines to citizens using, investing, or trading bitcoin. Today, bitcoin is classified as a convertible decentralized virtual currency by the U.S. Treasury as well as a commodity by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The IRS has published a [guide](https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance) stating that general tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to virtual currency.  This means that typical transactions used with real currencies today, such as paying wages to an employee with bitcoin, are taxable to the employee and “must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.” The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) have also made their voice heard as the SEC issued an investor alert in regards to the potential risks of virtual currency investments while NASAA labeled digital currency as a major threat to investors.

Additionally, popular exchanges such as [Coinbase](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/1496488-how-do-i-report-taxes-) provide a specialized Cost Basis for Taxes report which will help individuals with filing their taxes, including a summary of capital gains or losses. Large financial services companies such as Fidelity have also started integrating Coinbase for their clients to see both their U.S. dollar and digital currency holdings in one place.
