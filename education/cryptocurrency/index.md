# Cryptocurrency
Crypto is a short way to say cryptography, which is the study of using math to keep something secret and safe. So when you put “crypto” and “currency” together, you get cryptocurrency; money that is kept safe using math.

#### Where did it all begin?
In 2008, a person (or group of people) under the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" wrote a paper about a digital money system he called "Bitcoin", which used something he called a "Blockchain". Bitcoin has inspired other people to create hundreds of other cryptocurrencies since then

#### What makes it so exciting?
One of the reasons cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity is that they are a type of money that is decentralized. This means that banks don't have the final say when it comes to your money.

## Blockchains
A blockchain is a list of messages, and part of each message is the time the message was sent - like a big notebook with page numbers. Cryptocurrencies use a blockchain to keep track of how much money people have.
