## [What makes it valuable?](#what-makes-it-valuable)
You may be wondering how cryptocurrencies are worth real money. Let's break it down using a familiar example.

**The US Dollar**: a currency used to buy things in the United States. A dollar is simply a piece of paper with some numbers on it. What makes it worth anything more than a cryptocurrency? You may be thinking, "isn't the dollar backed by gold?", but you'd be wrong. It hasn't been backed by gold since [1934](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12770.htm). But to keep it simple, lets pretend we took a small trip back in time. Gold has **<lookup key="intrinsic-value">intrinsic value</lookup>**. It can be made into jewelry, it's conductive, so it can be used in electrical stuff (such as your computer or smartphone) yet doesn't rust, unlike copper. While it is possible to make gold, the amount of money that it costs is more than the money you could get from selling it, which means there is a limited amount of it. These reasons show why gold has value. But what about cryptocurrencies?

#### Are cryptocurrencies a limited resource?
For most cryptocurrencies, there is a limited number of "coins" that can be available at any given time. You can't simply "create" a bitcoin and add it to your wallet, due to cryptography and transaction logging. Coins are currently created by "miners" who form the backbone of any cryptocurrency. Mining often requires much more computing power than the average person has access to, but fortunately for us, we do not need to be a miner in order to use cryptocurrency.

#### Do they have intrinsic value?
Well, yes and no. For example, Bitcoin can be seen as a "store of value" with its price being depending on supply and demand. The more people that think bitcoins are worth something, the more people buy into it and the price goes up. Other forms of cryptocurrencies may have value because their blockchains provide the capability to run "smart contracts" which are a list of actions that run according to a plan. Smart contracts are a new concept but they are believed to provide safe ways of ensuring that two or more parties hold up their end of a bargain. For instance, a smart contract could be made to automatically pay the pizza company when the delivery man drops off the pizza. If the pizza never arrives, then the company never gets paid. But if the pizza does arrive, then the customer cannot take the pizza and refuse to pay.

## [Who buys cryptocurrencies?](#who-buys-cryptocurrencies)
There are a lot of different people who buy cryptocurrencies. There are many currencies, each trying to solve existing problems of the centralized systems, or create new applications using blockchain technology.

#### Day Traders
Just like in the stock market there are people who want to profit from the changing prices of cryptocurrencies. They purchase a currency when the price is low and sell it when the price is high. Many cryptocurrencies change price much more quickly than stocks and are able to gain or lose over 20% of their value in a single day. This makes for a very profitable outcome if a trader is able to time the market ups and downs.

#### Holders
Some people believe that cryptocurrencies will change the way people do online banking. They believe that eventually, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will become common, and used for everything from paying your electricity bill to buying food at a restaurant. By buying now at a discounted price, they think the value of their currency will go up as more people use it.

#### Corporations
Some cryptocurrencies have drawn interest from large companies; Microsoft, Santander, and JP Morgan (to name a few) are interested in a cryptocurrency called Ethereum. These companies may try to use blockchain technology to make certain operations more efficient and take advantage of the fast transaction speed, resulting in cheaper operational costs.
