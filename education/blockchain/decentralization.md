# Decentralization
Most cryptocurrencies are decentralized, which means that nobody who owns cryptocurrency has more information or power than anyone else. 

### Think of it like this
It's like playing poker; since every player can see how many chips every other player has, nobody can get away with saying they have more money than they really do.
