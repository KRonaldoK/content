# Decentralization
Most cryptocurrencies are decentralized, which means that nobody who owns cryptocurrency has more information or power than anyone else. 

### Think of it like this
In a decentralized bank, every customer gets a copy of the bank records(**blockchain**), so everyone can see how much money everyone else has.

### Why is decentralization important?

Decentralization spreads out the power, so no one user/person/entity has absolute control.  A typical government regulated bank is *centralized*, because although we all put our money into it, the bank has the final say in how much each person has. If I put in $100 to my account, the only people that know how much I deposited are me and the bank. The bank could then tell every other customer that I only have $1 in my account, so I can not transfer 100$ to someone else.

In a decentralized bank, if a teller at the bank tries to tell everyone I only have $1, they can look at the bank records(**blockchain**) to see that I really have 100$.

Another reason why decentralization is important is because it stops a service(like a bank, or program) from having a single point of failure. If the CEO of the centralized bank is the only one that can see the records, he could decide to take $100 from 10 different accounts to pay himself, and the rest of the bank wouldn't know, it would be the 10 customers words versus the CEO. If the CEO's computer, which contained the only copy of all the bank records, suddenly got a virus and broke, there would be no official record of everyone's money. In a decentralized version, because everyone else has the records and they're all kept up to date, if a single person's records were destroyed, they could get a copy from someone else who uses the bank. If they tried to edit the records to say they had $1,000,000, their records wouldn't match up with the rest of the decentralized records, and would be ignored.
