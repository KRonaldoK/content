# Decentralization
One of the reasons cryptocurrencies are growing in popularity is that they are a type of money that is decentralized. This means that there is no part of the system that has more information or power than any other part. It's like playing poker at a table where any player can see the chips that every other player has, and everybody's cards are face up - if anyone tries to lie, everyone will know. Most cryptocurrencies are based on decentralized systems.
