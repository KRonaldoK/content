# Forking
A fork in a blockchain is like a fork in a road; one part of the chain keeps going down the path it used to, but the other part of the chain takes a new path. Usually when a blockchain forks, it is because some of the computer code that makes the blockchain work has been updated, and the only way to update the chain is to make a new path.
