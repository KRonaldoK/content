# Forking
A fork in a blockchain how a blockchain can be updated. Since blocks on a chain can't be changed once they are created, forking is the only way to update the way a blockchain works.

## Think of it like this
A fork in a blockchain is like a fork in a road; one part of the chain keeps going down the path it used to, but the other part of the chain takes a new path.

## Soft Fork

## Hard Fork

## Update

## Rewind
