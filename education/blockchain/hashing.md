# Hashing
A hash is like a fingerprint. Everybody has one, and everyone's is different. If you see a person, it is really easy to make a copy of their fingerprint (just have them press their finger on something). But if you see a fingerprint, it is impossible to create a copy of the person whose fingerprint it is. 

Blockchains hash the blocks that they add to the chain so that they can see if the order of the blocks is right without having to look at each entire block.
