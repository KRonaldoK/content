# Wallets
A digital wallet is a place for you to store your cryptocurrency.

## Think of it like this
A digital wallet like a bank account; you can put your money in and take your money out, but you never want to give somebody else access to your wallet.

## Addresses
A blockchain address is a number that can be used to send cryptocurrency to a specific wallet. A wallet can have many addresses, but each address should only be used once.

## Think of it like this
An address is like a cheap, displosable mailbox. Other people know that if they want to send you something, they need to put it in your mailbox. But because it's cheap, you only use the mailbox one time before replacing it.
