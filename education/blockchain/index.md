# Blockchain
In order to understand what a cryptocurrency is, it is important to understand what a blockchain is. A blockchain is the technology that allows cryptocurrencies to work. A blockchain is a list of messages where a part of each message is the time the message was sent - like a big notebook of transactions with page numbers. By looking at the last page of this notebook (or the last block in the blockchain), you can tell how much money a person has.
