# [What is Mining?](#mining)
You may have heard the term "mining" referred to when reading about cryptocurrencies and wondered what it is. Mining is the system that allows new transactions to get added to the blockchain. Mining is the act of checking that transactions are valid; that the user wishing to send the currency actually holds that amount, and that there isn't anything fishy going on. By doing this miners "secure" the blockchain and are rewarded for their efforts.

Miners around the world belong to a network that together secure the blockchain. The actual act of "mining" is done on computers, by crunching numbers at speeds not possible by humans.

### Mining Analogy
Imagine you are in a classroom and the teacher writes this word problem on the board:

"What number when multiplied by itself equals a number with the digits '42' next to each other like that somewhere in the number? It could be 142, 242, ect." The first person to find it gets an extra credit point!"

So you start furiously pounding numbers into your calculator.
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144... crap, this is not gonna be easy. But you keep going.

Finally at 57 x 57 you see it! Yay! But just as you see it somebody else shouts "57!"

"Great job, Billy! You get to keep or give out 5 extra credit points however you want! Tomorrow morning write on the whiteboard at the front of the class so everyone can see it, who you want to give those points to. You can also divide points into decimals if you'd like." The rest of the day you hear the stories of what people are offering to give to Billy for one of the extra credit points. Billy is the only student who holds extra credit points so he gets some pretty good offers. You are so jealous!

The next morning, Billy writes down the names of the 4 people who he decided to points to. Then the teacher says, "Every day only a maximum of 3 people can get points given to them by someone else. Whoever gets the answer to the next math problem gets to decide which 3 of the 4 points Billy gave to people get given out today. Ok, so what is the next number that will give you a '42' somewhere in it?"

The class immediately starts pounding on their calculators again! 58? No. 59? No. 60? No.

10 minutes later Alice shouts out "64!" Same deal. She gets 4 extra credit points to use however she wants. Billy approaches her and offers her a tenth of a point to include the point he gave to his best friend Carl in the 3 transfers that get included today. She includes Billy to Carl first, then chooses 2 other transfers randomly and begins thinking of who she wants to give hers to.

Other students begin to trying to trade for Alice's extra credit points. She knows Billy got a better deal because yesterday he was the only one with points, but now more people have them so she settles for less.

While other kids are trading, you are looking at the problem and you sense a pattern. Being a bright kid you write a little program in your calculator to figure out the next answer. All your program does is take the last result and add one, then check to see if it works, over and over and over. Once it finds an answer, it's easy to check to make sure it works, but finding that answer is a boring process of checking every number against the formula. There simply is no better way!

The next morning, you finally get the next number first! Your ingenuity paid off! But every kid in the class has the same calculator, and they all start writing their own programs. The teacher sees this and says, "Aha! I see that you've started automating the search! Well the rules are changing a little!"

You watch as the teacher erases the simple equation on the board and writes down a huge long equation. "Find x where x to the power of x divided by 57 plus the square root ..." It goes on and on!

"Your little calculators might not be enough for this!"

When you get home you program the formula on your desktop computer. But it's still just a matter of trying a number, running it through the formula to see if you end up with a result that matches the teacher's requirement. This time the goal is get as close to zero as possible. "0.09 or less, but not negative".

Your computer starts running the calculations. It checks a number, then adds 1 and checks that number. Then adds 1 and checks that number. It runs for an hour, and nothing works! You give up and go to bed.

The next morning, one of the other students named Sarah proudly claims the prize! "How did you do it? I ran the calculations for an hour and nothing worked!"

Sarah says "I just left it running all night! There was an answer when I woke up."

## Proof of Work

## Proof of Stake
Imagine you are at the fairground and there are two rollercoasters, getting to ride the coaster is your reward, like signing the block and getting the coins in crypto. If you want to ride the PoW coaster, every 10 minutes there is a race, whoever can run fastest (has the fastest hashing equipment) wins the race and gets to ride. The same people tend to be fastest every race, and always get to ride, slower runners never get a ride. People started forming relay teams (pools) to get a chance on the coaster. The PoS rollercoaster is different, there are a bunch of queues in parallel, if you are rich you go in the rich queue and get to the front faster, but no matter how poor you are you always get a ride in the end. Who is chosen from the front of those parallel queues is random, but the VIP queue has less people in it so they progress to the front quicker. PoS uses coin balance x time since last transaction to build 'stake weight', higher stake weight makes you get to the front faster. Once you sign the block (ride the coaster) your stake weight is set to zero and time starts again (you go to the back of the queue system).
