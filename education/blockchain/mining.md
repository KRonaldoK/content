# Mining
Mining is how new transactions get added to a blockchain. Something has to be done in order to add transactions to the chain, and depending on how the chain is set up, there are a few different ways this can happen.

### Think of it like this
In order to make sure that transactions are secure, somebody has to so a little bit of extra work before adding a transaction to the chain. 

## Hashing
Hashing a message means doing a math problem using the message to get an answer that can only be found using that message.

### Think of it like this
A hash is like a fingerprint. Everybody has one, and everyone's is different. If you see a person, it is really easy to make a copy of their fingerprint (just have them press their finger on something). But if you see a fingerprint, it is impossible to create a copy of the person whose fingerprint it is.
