# Blockstreet Education Section
This is the most important part of the site that is intended to be the main draw of new users to the site. This is our "onboarding" for new users into the Blockchain ecosystem. The content is supposed to be very easy to understand, and we try to stick to a 5th grade reading level. It can be a little difficult to dumb things down sometimes, but everyone from a teenager to a 70 year old gradma needs to be able to read and understand so long as they give it some of their time.

## Topic Diagram
We created this diagram to illustrate the topics that comprise what we call the "Cryptocurrency Ecosystem". There are two concept levels, one technical and one economical.

This breakdown allows our users to navigate through the education section in a organized way. It also allows us to show from a high level, all of the different parts that makeup the whole.

### Pathing
One of the important benefits of this structure is the ability to draw a path through the different topics of the diagram based on the level of exposure that the user wishes to experience. We can either take a predefined approach, or a free-roaming approach. Let's go over some examples of these two methods.

#### Example Investor Path
A father living in the suburbs who has been casually investing in stocks for around ten years hears about Cryptocurrency and wishes to learn more. The Blockstreet website is linked to him by an associate, and he enters the education section. He is presented with an overview explaining how the guide works, a top level view of cryptocurrency & blockchain, and how he can proceed.

The education landing page (first page the user visits) prompts him to pick the level of exposure he wishes to have. Given he only invests casually and wants to play around with investing in some Cryptocurrency, he doesn't care about the underlying technology and wishes to only know about the economical side of things.

The guide begins by giving him an extremely brief section on how Blockchain technology works (the Blockchain index page), then he is immediately taken to the Cryptocurrency concept and dives into the various topics there. None of the topics go into extreme detail, and the path focuses on ending on "how to invest" so he can read about exchanges and trading on the platform.

After finishing the main path, he is told of the various other topics he should feel free to explore either immediately after (if he has been intrigued), or at a later date.

#### Example Innovator Path
An entrepenuer living in New York city attends a networking event one night and hears about this upcoming technology called "blockchain", and how the new internet is being built there. He hears about these companies building applications that are raising tens of millions of dollars in minutes. He is intriged and wishes to learn more about this technology and is referred to the Blockstreet site by an associate. He ends up on the education section and is presented with the same overview as the investor.

He is prompted for his level of exposure, and he opts for a more technical path, as he wishes to truly understand the technology.

The guide begins by explaining Blockchain from a very high level, and continues to iterate through each of the topics that comprise blockchain technology. He learns about addresses, how mining works, public & private key cryptography, and various other technical concepts. He dives deep into each of these topics and completes the blockchain area of the diagram. He is then brought over to the cryptocurrency for an overview of what cryptocurrency is and how it works. Due to his underlying understanding of blockchain he picks it up quickly.

This is where his path ends, and just like the investor is told of the various other topics he should feel free to explore, such as exchanges, and the economics involved with price.
