# Blockstreet Education Section
This is the most important part of the site that is intended to be the main draw of new users to the site. This is our "onboarding" for new users into the Blockchain ecosystem. The content is supposed to be very easy to understand, and we try to stick to a 5th grade reading level. It can be a little difficult to dumb things down sometimes, but everyone from a teenager to a 70 year old gradma needs to be able to read and understand so long as they give it some of their time.

## Topic Diagram
We created this diagram to illustrate the topics that comprise what we call the "Cryptocurrency Ecosystem". There are two concept levels, one technical and one economical.

This breakdown allows our users to navigate through the education section in a organized way. It also allows us to show from a high level, all of the different parts that makeup the whole.

### Pathing
One of the important benefits of this structure is the ability to draw a path through the different topics of the diagram based on the level of exposure that the user wishes to experience. We can either take a predefined approach, or a free-roaming approach. Let's go over some examples of these two methods.

#### Example Predefined Path
A father living in the suburbs who has been casually investing in stocks for around ten years hears about Cryptocurrency and wishes to learn more. The Blockstreet website is linked to him by an associate, and he enters the education section. He is presented with an overview explaining how the guide works, a top level view of cryptocurrency & blockchain, and how he can proceed.

The education landing page (first page the user visits) prompts him to pick the level of exposure he wishes to have. Given he only invests casually and wants to play around with investing in some Cryptocurrency, he doesn't care about the underlying technology and wishes to only know about the economical side of things.

The guide begins by giving him an extremely brief section on how Blockchain technology works (the Blockchain index page), then he is immediately taken to the Cryptocurrency concept and dives into the various topics there. None of the topics go into extreme detail, and the path focuses on ending on "how to invest" so he can read about exchanges and trading on the platform.

After finishing the main path, he is told of the various other topics he should feel free to explore either immediately after (if he has been intrigued), or at a later date.
