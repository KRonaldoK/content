Per the hangouts discussion, I want to see what a "storytime" description of CC and BC look like.

## Introduction
In 2008, a person (or group of people) under the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto" released a document describing a global digital currency system controlled by no one entity, but is instead controlled by every user of the system via a technology he called a "Blockchain". This document spawned the first cryptocurrency "Bitcoin", but would eventually be the inspiration for hundreds of other cryptocurrencies.  Let's explore the concepts of blockchain and cryptocurrency by drawing parallels to more familiar ideas.

## Blockchain
The first step in understanding how cryptocurrecies work is by understanding the concept of a blockchain.  Fortunately, this is pretty easy; every time you see the word blockchain, just think "giant notebook".

## Decentralization
One of the biggest advantages blockchains offer is the idea of decentralization...but what exactly does that mean?  Decentralization means that instead of one (or a few) members of a community holding copies of information, every member of the community holds a copy of the information.

## Digital Signature
A digital signature performs the same function on computers that a hand-written signature does on paper - it shows that a person is who they say they are.

## Private and Public Keys
Private and public keys are the building blocks for digial signatures, and their names give a pretty good indication as to how they are used.  A private key is a key that you keep hidden from everybody else; you use your private key to digitally sign something.  A public key is a key that you share with the entire world; other people use your public key to verify that a digial signature is from the person they say they are.

## Digital Wallet
A digital wallet is the cryptocurrency equivalent to a bank account.  Like bank accounts, digital wallets have unqiue addresses to identify them by.

## Analogy Time
Let's consider the scenario where a person (Alice) owes a person (Bob) $10.  They live in a neighborhood with Carl and Dora, who will make appearances later on.  On the left Alice pays Bob via check, on the right she pays him via crytocurrency

| Traditional Currency | Cryptocurrency |
| --- | --- |
| Alice writes a $10 check with Bob's name on the "to" line | Alice writes a note saying that her wallet address intends to send $10 worth of currency to Bob's wallet address |
| Alice signs the check in cursive, with a pen | Alice digitally signs her note using her private key |
| Alice gives the check to Bob | Alice posts the note in a place where everyone can see |
| Alice's bank makes sure that the signature on the check matches the signature they have on file for her | Bob, Carl, and Dora use Alice's public key to verify that the note was written by Alice |
| Alice's bank makes sure that Alice's account has at least $10 in it | Bob, Carl, and Dora all check their copies of the blockchain to make sure that Alice has at least $10 worth of currency |
| If Alice has enough money, $10 is deducted from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not, the transaction is rejected | If Alice has enough money, Alice, Bob, Carl, and Dora note in their copies of the blockchain that $10 worth of currency was deducted from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not, the transaction is rejected |

One thing you may have noticed in the left hand column is that we are putting a lot of trust into the bank.  If the bank makes a mistake, decides to be a jerk, or loses its data in some catastrophic event, anyone who put their trust in the bank stands to lose their money.  In the right hand column, all of the bookkeeping is replicated by every member of the neighboorhood.  If Alice tries to claim that she has more money than she really does, Bob, Carl, and Dora will overrule her claim by a majority.  If Carl's blockchain is destroyed somehow, he can simply ask Dora to show him her copy, and by copying it down, Carl is able to recover his lost blockchain
