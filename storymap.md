Per the hangouts discussion, I want to see what a "storytime" description of CC and BC look like.

## Introduction
In 2008, a person (or group of people) under the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto" released a document detailing a digital currency system controlled by its users, rather than a corporation or a government. This document led to the first major cryptocurrency "Bitcoin", and inspired hundreds of other cryptocurrencies.  Let's explore the concepts of blockchain and cryptocurrency by drawing parallels to more familiar ideas.

## Blockchain
The first step in understanding how cryptocurrencies work is by understanding the concept of a blockchain.  Fortunately, this is pretty easy; every time you see the word blockchain, just think **giant notebook**. This **giant notebook** keeps track of all transactions for a cryptocurrency.

## Decentralization
One of the biggest advantages blockchains offer is the idea of decentralization... but what exactly does that mean?  Decentralization means that instead of one (or a few) members of a community holding copies of information, every member of the community holds a copy of the information.

## Digital Signature
A digital signature is the same thing for computers that a hand-written signature is for paper - it shows that a person is who they say they are. Whenever you see "digital signature", just remember that it is a signature for computers.

## Private and Public Keys
Private and public keys are the building blocks for digital signatures, and their names help us understand how they are used.  A private key is a key that you keep hidden from everybody else; you use your private key to digitally sign something.  A public key is a key that you share with the entire world; other people use your public key to make sure that your digial signature is actually yours.

## Digital Wallet
A digital wallet is basically the same thing as a bank account.  Digital wallets have unique addresses to identify them, similar to a checking account's account number and routing number.

## Analogy Time
Let's consider the scenario where a person (Alice) owes another person (Bob) $10.  They live in a neighborhood with Carl and Dora, who will make appearances later on.  On the left Alice pays Bob with a check, on the right she pays him using crytocurrency

| Check | Cryptocurrency |
| --- | --- |
| Alice writes a $10 check with Bob's name on the "to" line | Alice writes a note saying that her wallet address wants to send $10 worth of coins to Bob's wallet address |
| Alice signs the check in cursive, using a pen | Alice digitally signs her note using her private key |
| Alice gives the check to Bob | Alice posts the note somewhere that everyone can see |
| Alice's bank makes sure that the signature on the check matches the signature they have on file for her | Bob, Carl, and Dora use Alice's public key to verify that the note was written by Alice |
| Alice's bank makes sure that Alice's account has at least $10 in it | Bob, Carl, and Dora all check their copies of the blockchain (**giant notebook**) to make sure that Alice has at least $10 worth of coins |
| If Alice has enough money, $10 is deducted from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not, the she is told she doesn't have enough money | If Alice has enough money, Alice, Bob, Carl, and Dora note in their copies of the blockchain (**giant notebook**) that $10 worth of coins were deducted from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not, Alice is told she doesn't have enough money |

One thing you may have noticed in the left hand column is that we are putting a lot of trust into the bank.  If the bank makes a mistake, decides to be a jerk, or loses its data somehow, anyone who put their trust in the bank could lose their money.  In the right hand column, all of the records are copied by every member of the neighborhood.  If Alice tries to claim that she has more money than she really does, Bob, Carl, and Dora will know that she is lying.  If Carl's blockchain (**giant notebook**) is destroyed somehow, he can simply ask Alice, Bob, or Dora to show him their copy, and Carl can recover his lost blockchain (**giant notebook**).
