Per the hangouts discussion, I want to see what a "storytime" description of CC and BC look like.

## Introduction
In 2008, a person (or group of people) under the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto" released a paper explaining a set of rules for a digital currency controlled by its users, rather than a company or a government. This paper led to the first major cryptocurrency "Bitcoin", and inspired hundreds of other cryptocurrencies.  Let's explore the ideas of blockchain and cryptocurrency by comparing them to more familiar ideas.

## Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a word that you might not have seen very much, so what is it?  A cryptocurrency is a system that gives value to tokens called coins.  Whenever you see the word cryptocurrency, just think **online money**.

## Blockchain
The first step in understanding how **online money** works is by understanding the idea of a blockchain.  Fortunately, this is pretty easy; every time you see the word blockchain, just think **giant notebook**. This **giant notebook** keeps track of all transactions for a **online money**.

## Decentralization
One of the biggest advantages **giant notebooks** offer is the idea of decentralization... but what does that mean?  Decentralization means that instead of one (or a few) members of a group holding copies of information, every member of the group holds a copy of the information.

## Digital Signature
A digital signature is the same thing for computers that a hand-written signature is for paper - it shows that a person is who they say they are. Whenever you see "digital signature", just think **computer signature**.

## Private and Public Keys
Private and public keys are the building blocks for **computer signatures**, and their names help us understand how they are used.  A private (or secret) key is a key that you keep hidden from everybody else; you use your private key to put your **computer signature** on something.  A public key is a key that you share with the entire world; other people use your public key to make sure that your **computer signature** is actually yours.

## Digital Wallet
A digital wallet is basically the same thing as a bank account.  Digital wallets have unique addresses to identify them, similar to a checking account's account number and routing number.

## Example
Let's consider the scenario where a person (Alice) owes another person (Bob) $10.  They live in a neighborhood with Carl and Dora, who will also be a part of our example.  On the left Alice pays Bob with a check, on the right she pays him using cryptocurrency

| Check | Online Money |
| --- | --- |
| Alice writes a $10 check with Bob's name on the "to" line | Alice writes a note saying that her wallet address wants to send $10 worth of coins to Bob's wallet address |
| Alice signs the check in cursive, using a pen | Alice puts her **computer singature** on her note |
| Alice gives the check to Bob | Alice posts the note somewhere that everyone can see |
| Alice's bank makes sure that the signature on the check matches the one they have on file for her | Bob, Carl, and Dora use Alice's public key to make sure that the note was written by Alice |
| Alice's bank makes sure that Alice's account has at least $10 in it | Bob, Carl, and Dora all check their copies of the **giant notebook** to make sure that Alice has at least $10 worth of **online money** |
| If Alice has enough money, $10 is taken from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not, the she is told she doesn't have enough money | If Alice has enough money, Alice, Bob, Carl, and Dora note in their copies of the **giant notebook** that $10 worth of coins was taken from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not, Alice is told she doesn't have enough money |

In the left hand column, we are putting a lot of trust into the bank.  If the bank makes a mistake, decides to be a jerk, or loses its data somehow, anyone who put their trust in the bank could lose their money.  That's because in the end, the bank gets the final say; if the bank says you only have $5, you only have $5.

In the right hand column, all of the records are copied by every member of the neighborhood.  If Alice lies and says that she has more money than she really does, Bob, Carl, and Dora will know that she is lying.  They will all get together and come to an agreement on how much money each person has.  But what if Carl's **giant notebook** is destroyed somehow?  Because everybody has a copy of the same **giant notebook**, he can ask Alice, Bob, or Dora if he can make a copy of theirs, so he can get his back.
