# [What is Cryptocurrency?](#what-is-cryptocurrency)
Crypto is a short way to say cryptography, which is the study of using math to keep something secret and safe. So when you put “crypto” and “currency” together, you get cryptocurrency; money that is kept safe using math.

## [Where did it all begin?](#the-beginning)
In 2008, a person (or group of people) under the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" wrote a paper about a digital money system he called "Bitcoin", which used something he called a "Blockchain". Bitcoin has inspired other people to create hundreds of other cryptocurrencies since then

## [What makes it so exciting?](#why-the-hype)
One of the reasons cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity is that they are a type of money that is decentralized. This means that banks don't have the final say when it comes to your money.

## [Blockchains](#blockchains)
A blockchain is a list of messages, and part of each message is the time the message was sent - like a **<lookup key="notebook">big notebook</lookup>** with page numbers. Cryptocurrencies use a blockchain to keep track of how much money people have.

## [Side by Side Comparison](#analogy)
To help understand how cryptocurrencies work, let's pretend there is a person (Alice) who owes another person (Bob) $10. On the left, Alice pays Bob with a check, on the right, she pays him using a crytocurrency.

| Check | Cryptocurrency |
| --- | --- |
| Alice writes a $10 check with Bob's name on the "to" line | Alice writes a note saying that she wants to send Bob $10 |
| Alice gives the check to Bob | Alice posts the note on the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook</lookup>**) where anyone can see |
| Alice's bank makes sure that Alice's account has at least $10 in it | Bob checks his copy of the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook</lookup>**) to make sure that Alice has at least $10 worth of coins |
| If Alice has enough money, $10 is taken from her account and added to Bob's account.  If not then she is told she doesn't have enough money | If Alice has enough money, she and Bob write a new message in their copies of the blockchain (**<lookup key="notebook">big notebook</lookup>**) that $10 worth of coins was taken from her account and added to Bob's account. If Alice doesn't have enough money, Bob will tell her |
